```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r}
dat = read.table('realestate.txt', header = T)
head(dat)

Price=dat$SalePrice

Pairs Plot
```{r}
pairs(Price~Sq_feet+Beds+AC)

##Seems to be positive correlation between square feet and price. No correlation between beds and price. AC seems to be a good predictor as well. 
```

```{r}
pairs(Price~Garage+Pool+Year+Quality)
##Garage and Quality seem like good linear predictors. Year needs to be transformed. Pool seems ot have negative relationship
```

```{r}
pairs(Price~Style+Lot+Highway)
##Style is not a good predictor. Highway is a good predictor. Lot size is a good preidctor, probably needs to be transformed. 
```

```{r}
##fit price to square feet 

fit=lm(Price~Sq_feet)

plot(Sq_feet, Price ,xlab = 'Sq_feet', ylab = 'Price', main = 'Price vs Sq_Feet')
abline(fit)
s=summary(fit)
s

```

Hypothesis Test to see if there is a relationship between Price and Sq_feet
H0: B1=0=B3...B12=0    Ha: At least one of the Betas is not equal to 0. 
Pvalue is less than .05 so we can reject the null hypothesis that B1=0. 



```{r}
Price=dat$SalePrice
Sq_feet=dat$SqFeet
Beds=dat$Beds
AC=dat$Air
Garage=dat$Garage
Pool=dat$Pool
Year=dat$Year
Quality=dat$Quality
Style=dat$Style
Lot=dat$Lot
Highway=dat$Highway

mod.reduced = lm(Price ~ 1)
mod.full = lm(Price ~Sq_feet + Beds + Baths + AC + Garage + Pool + 
    Year + Quality + Style + Lot + Highway)
anova(mod.reduced, mod.full)

```
Pvalue is very close to 0 so we know that there is atleast one useful predictor.



Do AIC test to see which predictors are useful in the model. 
```{r}
step(mod.reduced, scope = list(lower = mod.reduced, upper = mod.full))




```
AIC test shows that SQ_feet, quality, style, year, lot, garage, beds, highway, and AC, are the best predictors for our model.


```{r}
mod.AIC = lm(formula = Price ~ Sq_feet + Quality + Style + Year + Lot + 
    Garage + Beds + Highway + AC)
summary(mod.AIC)


```
All Beta values are significant except for Highway and AC as their pval are large.
Conduct BIC test to see if similar results

```{r}
n = nrow(dat)
step(mod.reduced, scope = list(lower = mod.reduced, upper = mod.full), k = log(n))



```
BIC results were widely different that the AIC tests as it only includes Sq_feet, Quality, Style, Year and Lot. 

```{r}
mod.BIC = lm(formula = Price ~ Sq_feet + Quality + Style + Year + Lot)
summary(mod.BIC)

```
All these predictors are statistically significant


Pairs plot to check for interaction
```{r}
pairs(Price ~ Sq_feet + Quality + Style + Year + Lot)

```
Pairs plot shows that there seems to be some interaction between Quality and Sq_feet and Year and Sq_feet.


Hypothesis test to see if we should add interaction terms. 
```{r}
mod.reduced=lm(Price ~ Sq_feet + Quality + Style + Year + Lot)
mod.full=(Price ~ Sq_feet + Quality + Style + Year + Lot + Sq_feet*Quality + Sq_feet*Year)

anova1 <- anova(mod.reduced,mod.full)
anova1
