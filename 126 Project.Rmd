Pairs Plot
```{r}
pairs(Price~Sq_feet+Beds+AC)

##Seems to be positive correlation between square feet and price. No correlation between beds and price. AC seems to be a good predictor as well. 
```

```{r}
pairs(Price~Garage+Pool+Year+Quality)
##Garage and Quality seem like good linear predictors. Year needs to be transformed. Pool seems ot have negative relationship
```

```{r}
pairs(Price~Style+Lot+Highway)
##Style is not a good predictor. Highway is a good predictor. Lot size is a good preidctor, probably needs to be transformed. 
```

```{r}
##fit price to square feet 

fit=lm(Price~Sq_feet)

plot(Sq_feet, Price ,xlab = 'Sq_feet', ylab = 'Price', main = 'Price vs Sq_Feet')
abline(fit)
s=summary(fit)
s

```

Hypothesis Test to see if there is a relationship between Price and Sq_feet
H0: B1=0    Ha: B1!=0
Pvalue is less than .05 so we can reject the null hypothesis that B1=0. 
```{r}
mod.reduced = lm(Price ~ S + Examination + Infant.Mortality, data = swiss)
mod.full = lm(Fertility ~., data = swiss)
anova(mod.reduced, mod.full)
